# eventity

> Eventity is a native Android application built as part of my final project for my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Software Development) from the Natinoal College of Ireland. I am expecting to graduate in November 2018 and was awarded 87/100 for this.

> Eventity is a serverless Android Application which serves as a social calendar for teams to use. The app is targeted at small to medium enterprises as a way to allow them to organise social events within clogging up the inbox. Having a focal point where employees can ask questions on events means that the events committe/HR team answering the same things constantly. 

>Powered by Google's Firebase platform, the app features three levels of permissions: Oweners, Admins and Members. Owners and Admins can create events to be displayed, manage the team and can access the questions asked by Members. Members can see the events, mark themselves as going or not, see who's going to an event and ask questions on it.
